// Multiplies R0 and R1 and stores the result in R2.
//
// Assumptions:
// - R0, R1, R2 refer to RAM[0], RAM[1], and RAM[2], respectively.
// - You can assume that you will only receive arguments that satisfy:
//   R0 >= 0, R1 >= 0, and R0*R1 < 32768.
// - Your program does not need to test these conditions.
//
// Requirements:
// - Your program should not change the values stored in R0 and R1.
// - You can implement any multiplication algorithm you want.

// Pusedo code:
//sum = 0
//i = 1
//for (i<R2; i=i+1)
//    sum=sum+R1


// Initilaze sum and i
@R2
M=0

@i
M=0

(LOOP)
    // Check if i > R1
    @R1
    D=M

    @i
    D=D-M

    @END
    D;JEQ

    // Add R1 to sum and increment i
    @R0
    D=M

    @R2
    M=M+D

    // i=i+1
    @i
    M=M+1

    // Jump back to the loop condition
    @LOOP
    0;JMP    

(END)
    // End of the program
    @END
    0;JMP
